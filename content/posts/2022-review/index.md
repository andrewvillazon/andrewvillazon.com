With the year done and dusted, it's time to look back at the year that was 2022.

## Published less

2022 was a busy year, with a few different things taking me away from writing. The hectic nature of the year meant that I wrote far fewer articles in 2022.

Since starting this site, I've realized that I prefer to publish when I've got something to write rather than producing content for content's sake.

Despite the lack of time this year, I completed three articles. In reverse chronological order:

* [Recursive CTEs in SQL Server](/recursive-cte-sql-server)
* [6 lessons from a Machine Learning project](/6-lessons-machine-learning-project)
* [Creating custom scikit-learn Transformers](/custom-scikit-learn-transformers)

## Changed jobs

Midway through the year, I decided it was time to shift into a new role with a new company and industry. Where I previously worked with Health Data, the foreseeable future sees me working with Energy Industry Data.

The new role also involves a new tech stack, including Oracle, dbt, and Databricks, and it's an exciting opportunity to learn a ton more stuff.

## Completed a funded Machine Learning project

In 2019 I was awarded research funding to develop Machine Learning models that could predict Hospital Admissions from an Emergency Department.

In 2022, I completed, deployed, and integrated these models, which has been one of the highlights of my professional life. Throughout the project, I discovered a substantial amount about the real-world practice of Machine Learning (spoiler alert: it's nothing like the tutorials) and reflected on it in more detail [here](/6-lessons-machine-learning-project).

## Started an open-source project

Late in 2022, I started work on [pbipy](https://github.com/andrewvillazon/pbipy), a Python wrapper for the Power BI Rest API. There are plenty of Power BI wrappers out there, but I wanted to combine a few features of other API wrappers I'd used, namely the [Jira API wrapper](https://jira.readthedocs.io/).

The project is also an excuse to learn about package deployment and explore a few more language features in Python.

## What's in store for 2023?

Here are a few of the things I'm thinking about for the year:

* **Site revamp**: I've been quietly re-writing the site from scratch, updating for the latest version of Gatsby, and integrating Tailwind.
* Dark mode
* Virtual Environments in Python
* Data Pipelines with Function Composition
* Ways to improve SQL queries
* Readability in SQL queries
* Visualizing Database Object dependencies with GraphViz
* Explore DuckDB
* dbt

## Summing up

2022 was the slowest year for the blog, but despite this, it's still actively maintained, and I continue to enjoy writing (when inspiration strikes).

Thanks for reading in **2022**.
