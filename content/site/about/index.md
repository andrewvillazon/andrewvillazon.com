title: "About me"
summary: "About Andrew Villazon"
---

I'm Andrew Villazon, a Data Professional.

## Day-to-day

I write SQL and Python in a Data Warehouse environment. I also use tools like Tableau and PowerBI for Data Visualisation.

I'm happiest making SQL queries go fast (query tuning) or using Python to do just about everything else.

## Why I write

I started this site to share how I'd solved a problem or something that I'd discovered and thought others might find helpful.

When I do write, I try and draw on my own practical experience as much as possible. I like instructional content that leans towards solving real problems.

Because of this, you'll probably find my content very "data centric."

## About this site

This site was built with Gatsby. If you're interested in reading about the experience of working with Gatsby, I documented it [here](/building-my-personal-site-in-gatsby/).

Unlike many Gatsby sites, I opted not to host on Netlify. To get equivalent automation, I use Github Actions and wrote about my setup [here](/automatically-deploying-with-github-actions/).

## Acknowledgments

The design of [taniaracsia.com](https://www.taniarascia.com/) heavily influenced the creation of this site. I hope she doesn't mind. 

I like the clean minimal design that helps focus on the content. I've never met Tania but have enjoyed using her site, and it's full of useful content.
