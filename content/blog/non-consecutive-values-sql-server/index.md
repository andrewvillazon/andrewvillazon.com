In this two-part series, we'll look at different solutions to a SQL problem - how to identify consecutive or non-consecutive values in a column. Also known as the Gaps and Islands problem. 

Understanding the Gaps and Islands problem is useful for analyzing data that features sequences or breaks in sequences.

This post, part one of the series, will look at methods for identifying non-consecutive values (or Gaps). In part two, we explore ways to identify consecutive values (Islands).
