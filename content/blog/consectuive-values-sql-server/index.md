In this two-part series, we'll look at different solutions to a SQL problem - how to **identify consecutive** or **non-consecutive values** in a column. Also known as the **Gaps and Islands** problem. 

Understanding the Gaps and Islands problem is useful for analyzing data that features sequences or breaks in sequences.

This post, part two of the series, will look at methods for identifying **consecutive values (Islands)**. In part one, we explored ways to identify non-consecutive values (Gaps).
