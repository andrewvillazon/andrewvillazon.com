Machine Learning is a lot of fun, but it's not always straightforward and can be complex and sometimes messy. This post aims to reflect on some of the key learnings I took from recent work on a Machine Learning project.

Information about the practice of Machine Learning doesn't always get the attention it should. Hopefully, these thoughts give some insight that the practitioner finds useful.

### The project

The goal of this project was to develop Machine Learning models that could usefully predict Hospital Admissions from the Emergency Department of a tertiary Hospital. The purpose being to give Hospital managers advanced notice of incoming pressures on Hospital capacity.

I've been the sole practitioner on the project and responsible for every aspect, from data engineering to predictive modeling to deployment. It's been a steep learning curve, at times frustrating and slow, but ultimately a very satisfying project to have worked on.

Now, onto the lessons learned.
