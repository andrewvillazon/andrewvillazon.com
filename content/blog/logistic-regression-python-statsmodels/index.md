In this post, we'll look at performing Logistic Regression in Python with the statsmodels package.

First, we'll look at the different ways to do Logistic Regression in statsmodels and inspect the results. Then we'll look at some of the other things you might do with a Logistic Regression, such as accessing the model parameters, calculating odds ratios, and setting reference levels for categorical variables. 

Note that we won't cover using statsmodels Logistic Regression to make predictions (e.g., in a Machine Learning context). Instead, we'll cover using it as a tool for data exploration.
